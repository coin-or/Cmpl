*********** pyCMPLr ********
pyCMPL is the CMPL API  for Python and an interactive shell. 
The main idea of this API is 
* to define sets and parameters within the user application, 
* to start and control the solving process and 
* to read the solution(s) into the application if the problem is feasible. 
All variables, objective functions and constraints are defined in CMPL. 
These functionalities can be used with a local CMPL installation or a CMPLServer.
