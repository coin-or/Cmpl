*********** pyCMPLK and CMPLServer ********
Since release 1.8. the CMPL package contains also pyCMPL and CMPLServer
pyCMPL is the CMPL API  for Python and an interactive shell. 
The main idea of this API is 
* to define sets and parameters within the user application, 
* to start and control the solving process and 
* to read the solution(s) into the application if the problem is feasible. 
All variables, objective functions and constraints are defined in CMPL. 
These functionalities can be used with a local CMPL installation or a CMPLServer.

CMPLServer is an XML-RPC-based web service for distributed optimization.
It is reasonable to solve large models remotely on the CMPLServer that is installed on a high performance system.
pyCMPL provides a client API for CMPLServer. CMPL provides three XML-based file formats for the communication 
between a CMPLServer and its clients. (CmplInstance, CmplSolutions, CmplMessages)
